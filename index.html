<p>In club #203669 we have two main missions:</p>
<p>1)  Educate on wall street's manipulation and control of the stock market</p>
<p>and…</p>
<p>2)  Become the biggest club on FT</p>
<p>How do we do this? First and foremost, of course, a constant flow of high quality GMEmes... to win the hearts of the people. And to win their heads… daily chapters of content will cover the important topics that orbit $GME. So much happened during the first wave not to mention everything since then, so folks might appreciate a refresher on stuff like FTD (failure to deliver), the DRS (direct registration system), aggregate exposure, etc. and of course updates on where everything stands now.</p>
<p>I've created a website where all chapters will be hosted (after initially posting them here in the club), as well as some other types of content/info I have in mind. This will help solve the feed problem where in-depth content gets buried and scrolling through the history is cumbersome. The site will act as an easy reference point for all, and its links can be shared for easy access. The site will be here  —>  [[ https://203669.xyz ]]  It's simple for now (no design, only home page text) but I'll be continuously working to build it out. We'll aim for 1 new chapter per day, and I have a content calendar for new chapter topics that fills multiple weeks already. I'm not aware of any club building a reference site like this. Our influence will extend far and wide.</p>
<p>Other benefits that I want to add to the channel include $GME specific bots, that could ideally pull live price data and ideally an automated chart of the current/latest session (potentially with multiple timeframe options for customizing the request).</p>
<p>Now that I have an established plan in place, over the next 48 hours I'll be reaching out to the influencers of FT to connect and explain our movement.</p>
<p>Feel free to submit any ideas you have that may benefit the project.</p>
<p>IMPORTANT:  Please consider voting for me as president in order to prevent a hostile takeover of this club.</p>
<p>I appreciate you all. Let's take this thing to Valhalla.</p>
